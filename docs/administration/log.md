## Should I use embed message?
This depend on the the size of you server, if your server receive a lot of events then
we suggest you to use plain messages else if it receive only few events then use embed
messages. Embed messages are heavy and can affect the loading of the channel. Finally,
embed messages looks good on desktop, but not on mobile.
