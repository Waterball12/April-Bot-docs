Embed messages are enriched messages with additional feature than normal messages such as adding image
and using embed. With embed message you are able to create powerful message that contains a lot of 
information and that looks really cool. So, let's begin by explaining each field that you can
use on the embed message. Normally next to your embed message you'll be able to preview how
your message is going to look like.

* __**Message content**__: this is the message displayed outside of the embed, it can contain up
to 2000 characters.
