# Invite April
Did you just see [April bot features](https://aprilbot.me)? And now you are excited
to try out those features? Don't worry with this guide I will walk through each steep
to have April Bot on your server perfectly working.

## Below are the steeps to get April Bot on your server:

* Login into [Discord](https://discordapp.com/login) account on your browser

![Discord Login](https://i.redd.it/p87mbqmaadt01.png)

* Go into your server setting and make sure you have "**Manage Server**"
 permissions in that server, to check if you have those permissions just right click
 on the server and you should be able to see "**Server Settings**", therefore you
 should click on "**Overview**" option and a new window should pop up and there
 you should be able to edit options such as **Server Name**, **Server Region** and change
 the icon. If you cannot edit any of those option, then you do not have
 "**Manage Server**" permission and you should ask to the owner to give you those
 permission.

 * After you checked you have Manage Server permission you can go head and invite April
by [Clicking here](http://bit.ly/30J8v7e), after clicking the link you will be taken to
an authorization screen, here choose the server in the **Select a server** select box
and finally click on **Authorize** button.

!!! note
    You can change the permission that April will have in your server, just keep in mind
      that if April does not have required permission for a command it won't work, you
      can view the requirements of a command by using **!Help [Command]**, for
      example **!Help welcome test**. In alternative you can enable Verbose Errors
      that will always tell you the requirements, aliases and usage of command when it
      fails.
      
* Discord will verify whether you are a robot or a human, you should be able to pass
this test unless you are a robot

* An Authorized screen should appear, and you should be able to see April on
your discord server

!!! note
    April default
      Prefix is __**!**__
 
* Finally, test April by just typing !ping, and April should reply you with a pong and ms that
took to respond. You're now ready to use all the amazing feature and
[commands](https://aprilbot.me/commands) that [April](https://aprilbot.me)
offer.
