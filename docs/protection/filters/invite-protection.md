Invite protection is a filter that blocks users from sending discord invite, all your guild
invite will be ignored and only external one will trigger this filter.

## Settings

### Whitelist
You can set up a whitelist, remember to use the invite code and not the URL, so
 all the invites that match that invite code will be ignored
