 additional features than the old one such as automated actions, message customization,
  allowed role, ignored channel, whitelist and blacklist. Link protection keeps secure
   your channels from users linking unsecure or untrusted links, by default all links
    for discord domain will be ignored, but you can choose which links should be trusted
    and which not.

Link protection allows you to setup whitelist, means that all links sent that
matches any of the domain on the whitelist will be ignored, you don’t need to
add each subdomain of a domain, all subdomain on the whitelist will be
 included as well. Please make sure that the link you’re entering starts with https
  or http, for instance aprilbot.me will be ignored as whitelist item, you’ll have
   to add https://aprilbot.me.

## Blacklist
Link protection allows you to setup blacklist, means that all links sent that
matches any of the domain on the blacklist will trigger the filter, you don’t need to
add each subdomain of a domain, all subdomain on the blacklist will be
included as well. Please make sure that the link you’re entering starts with https
or http, for instance aprilbot.me will be ignored as blacklist item, you’ll have
to add https://aprilbot.me.
