Did you successfully logged into April but now you are getting trouble selecting the
guild? Let's then fix that. Selecting a guild is really easy but you'll be required to
have at least one server with **ManageGuild** or higher permission. Below an example
of how select guild looks like.

![Select guild](assets/images/dashboard-select-guild.png){.center}

To get to that screen you have to click on your avatar icon in the top bar navigation
and a dropdown menu will show up, there you can click on Dashboard option and get
on Select Guild screen.

In case you do not have any guild with ManageGuild then a different screen will be shown asking you
to get at least 1 server with **ManageGuild permission or higher** and it will
link a link on 
 [how to create a server](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server-){:target="_blank"rel="noopener"}
Below an example of how the screen looks like.

Finally, if you did not have any of those problems then you should be able to simply
click on the target guild and get on the dashboard screen. **If the bot is not on
the target guild then a new tab will be open asking you to invite April in that guild,
after inviting April on your guild refresh the page or use reload guild button**.
Else if April is already in the guild then a dashboard screen should appear.
