Below are listed the most common error that you can encounter while using April. The input text has too few/many parameters \u00b6 This is probably the 80% of command April command failure \ud83d\ude22, so let's start with why does this error appear? The reason is because you have supplied too many parameters or too few parameters as the error itself says, let's make an example with the command !Clear if you try to run !Clear 5 it most likely going to fail because there's not such a command that matches, yes !Clear is a command but adding that 5 mislead the command mapping. Running !Clear messages 5 it apparently looks like a valid command but adding that messages mislead the command mapping and results in a command error the right command is !Clear message 5 . So most of the time those errors are caused for wrong spelling. The error can also be caused because you're trying to execute a command that does not exist but has a fallback such as group commands. e.g. !Welcome set my welcome message this command will always fail there isn't a command that matches set , so the command mapping will guess that you're referring to !Welcome command that does not accept parameters. The best way to prevent those errors are to looking at the command documentation User requires guild permission \u00b6 The command failure of this error are approximately 1%, so why does this error appear? Its most likely that you're trying to execute a command that you do not have permission to use, you should ask to the owner of the server or user with Administrator permission to assign the required permission to execute that command. Where do they assign those permission? Get on your Server Setting -> Roles and there you can assign permissions to roles and therefore add those roles to users and get your permissions. Do you think you got those permission but keep getting this error? Then kick April and invite it again, the cause can also be server errors. Bot requires guild permission \u00b6 Why does this error appear? As the error say itself, April is missing the required permissions to execute the command. So how to fix it? get on your Server Setting -> Roles and there locate the April role or any role that you assigned to April and make sure that its has the required permission. If you invited April by using the provided link and did not touch any permission then you're more likely having already all permission, but if you are anyway getting this error then should probably kick April and invite it again, the cause can be a server error. User/Role/Channel not found \u00b6 Why does this error appear? As the error say itself the user, role or channel could not be found by April, it can be a misspelled word, try always to match the whole word using also capital letter is necessary. The error still appear? remember that you can always refer to a user/role/channel by using its mention, for mentioning a user and role start typing @ and they will automatically appear in the chat hints, for the role you wanna make sure that is mentionable by going on Server Setting -> Roles -> (Target role) -> Switch on Allow anyone to @mention this role . For mentioning a channel start typing # and it will automatically suggest you the channels. Still getting this annoying error? Then get the id of the user/role/channel by going on User Settings -> Appearance -> Advanced section -> Switch on Developer Mode. Now you can right click the user/role/channel and click on Copy ID therefore use that id in the command.

Discord hierarchy is how your roles are arranged, the higher role has more power than the lower, hierarchy is needed for April to assign roles for services like Autorole, Reaction Role or Selfrole , April cannot assign a role that is higher than its roles and giving an Administrator role won't solve the problem. So how to fix it? The solution is simple just arrange the roles in a way that April role is always at the top of the role that you're trying to setup. So where is this Discord hierarchy? You can find it by going Server Settings -> Roles. How do I arrange those roles? Its simple just drag and drop them, If you are the owner of the server then you can arrange the roles as you want, if you are a member then you more likely required to have Manage roles permission, in addition you cannot move role with higher hierarchy or move your role at the top. As you can see from the image above, the roles: Love dog , Love cat and Love duck can be assigned to user by April, but Dog master , Cat master and Duck master cannot be assign to user by April. To assign those roles you should set the April role at the top of them. Like so: Now any role in the guild can be assign to users by April if its setup, remember that you if you're planning to only setup 1 role then April role doesn't have to be at the very top but only higher than the role you're trying to setup.","title":"Hierarchy"},{"location":"protection/automated-actions/","text":"Automated action is a system that automatically performs specified action when the set warning threshold gets hit by users Warnings \u00b6 Indicate the threshold of warnings that triggers the automated action, make sure to not stack warnings, as only one automated action can be executed per time.
